This is my first web app game made using Javascript CSS and HTML. 


*********DISCLAMER****************

This game is my sample test. I just want to see what it is like coding a javascript game. 
Less than 12 hours was spend on this game.
Alot of variable is hard coded and has yet to be generalized. Alot of shortcuts were used
and is not acceptable for launch. This in no way reflect on my coding style or my coding skills.
