I am a third year student at University of Waterloo. I have worked as software developer for various companies.

I have recently got into programming during my free time. This workspace is used to create a timeline of my progress.
Please read the README of each project. It contain how to run the app or give a better understanding about the app. 

My first dummy app is Angry Teemo, rest of the projects will be taken more seriously.
